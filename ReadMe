Take monsters made from others in the class (See exercise 2). Create a classes for each, making at least 2 classes. Then create a monster army, with each monster being able to be drawn uniquely, based on the call to the class. You must have at least 3 methods. Create a program that draws your monster army to the screen at once. You may even make classes out of individual parts and swap them among monsters (ex, hairy arm, fleshy arm, buffer arm, robotic arm, etc).
